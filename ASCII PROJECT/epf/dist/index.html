      <title>Explanation Purpose</title>
  <body>
       <p>All computers at base level recongize 2 fucntions, off and on. So programers decided to use the binary numeral system to represent this, 0 is off and 1 is on. But there are hundreds, if not thousands, of different symbols such as letters and numbers which are needed to use language properly. Therefore a system called ASCII was devolped to represent this symbols in binary. The function/purpose of ASCII, again, is to be able to use different letters, numbers, and symbols on a computer using the binary system.</p>
